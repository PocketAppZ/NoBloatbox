# NoBloatbox - Bloatware Removal for Windows 11

NoBloatbox is the latest extension of my [Bloatbox app](https://github.com/builtbybel/bloatbox), now specifically designed for Windows 11! The app helps you identify and remove unnecessary bloatware that clutters your storage and slows down your system. The Windows 10 version of Bloatbox may have stopped working, but NoBloatbox brings the concept back—faster, better, and optimized for Windows 11.

### What is it?  
NoBloatbox allows you to find and remove pre-installed unnecessary programs (bloatware) on your Windows 11 system. The app relies on a community-driven signature file, which is regularly updated to recognize new bloatware. With an easy-to-use drag-and-drop interface, you can quickly clean up your system by removing bloatware.

---

### How does it work?

1. **Download the Signature File**  
   Download the signature file – a list of programs identified as bloatware. A default signature file is always included with the app (see “Assets”), but you can also use custom signatures from the community.

2. **Drag-and-Drop**  
   Simply drag and drop the downloaded signature file into the highlighted box in the app.

3. **Bloatware Search**  
   The bloatware search begins, and from there, you can start filtering and removing unwanted programs with ease!

### Installation:
1. Download the latest release from the [[Releases](https://github.com/builtbybel/NoBloatbox/releases) page.
2. Extract and run the application.
3. Follow the instructions above to start cleaning your system!

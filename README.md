# NoBloatbox

NoBloatbox is the latest extension of my [Bloatbox app](https://github.com/builtbybel/bloatbox), now specifically designed for Windows 11 (works on Win10 too)! The app helps you identify and remove unnecessary bloatware that clutters your storage and slows down your system. The Windows 10 version of Bloatbox may have stopped working, but NoBloatbox brings the concept back - simpler, faster, better, and optimized for Windows 11.

### What is it?  
NoBloatbox allows you to find and remove pre-installed unnecessary programs (bloatware) on your Windows 11 system. The app relies on a community-driven signature file, which is regularly updated to recognize new bloatware. With an easy-to-use drag-and-drop interface, you can quickly clean up your system by removing bloatware.

### How Does It Work?  

1. **Download a Filter or Plugin**  
   - [Filter for Windows 11](https://github.com/builtbybel/NoBloatbox/releases/download/0.31.0/targets1124H2.json)  
   - [Filter for Windows 10](https://github.com/builtbybel/NoBloatbox/releases/download/0.31.0/targets10.json)  

   These files contain curated lists of apps identified as bloatware. The app always comes with a default filter file (check the "Assets" section), but feel free to use custom filters from the community.  

2. **Drag and Drop**  
   Just drag and drop the downloaded filter or plugin file into the highlighted box in the app.  

3. **Bloatware Search**  
   The search kicks off automatically. From there, you can easily filter and remove unwanted apps!

### ðŸš€ Advanced  

**NoBloatbox** supports both **JSON files** and **PowerShell scripts**, offering advanced customization for power users.  

- **PowerShell and JSON Plugins:** Plugins are stored in the **Plugins Hub**, a dedicated section for extending app functionality.  
- **Bloatware Filters:** JSON scripts starting with an underscore (`_`) act as **Bloatware Filters**, providing even deeper control.  
- **Fully Flexible:** You can load **any PowerShell script** directly from GitHub or your local machine,
